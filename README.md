# Wakatime Farmer

Easily farm Wakatime hours to make yourself look more productive.

Works on most code-editors as long as it has Wakatime installed.

## Installation

  

- Clone the project

  

and then run

  

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

After it's doing installing, run

```

py farmer.py

```
## Starting
- To start it, you have to type in the language you want to farm (extensions only, like "py", "cpp" etc)
- It will then make a file for that, under the name of the extension name, a random number, and then ending in the extension.
- You will then have 10 seconds to switch to that file on your IDE.
- Refer to the table below under "Languages" to see how long it takes for a file to be done, or you can just Ctrl+C on the console to KeyboardInterrupt (quit)

##### Notes: Adding new languages and updating README.md daily, also VSC will say the code is wrong which it is, this is done so it still idles the language but the code isn't actually useful
